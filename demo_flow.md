## KEY TALKING POINTS TO WEAVE IN

Throughout the demo, emphasize:

1. **"Every interaction counts"** - Likes, follows, endorsements all feed MAINSTAGE
2. **"Anti-gaming"** - 3-day account age, max points per user
3. **"Proof for industry"** - Booking agents can trust these metrics
4. **"All-in-one"** - Musicians don't need 5 different platforms
5. **"Community-driven"** - Fans actively participate in discovery

---

## BACKUP TALKING POINTS (if questions arise)

**Q: How do you prevent fake accounts?**
> "Accounts must be 3 days old to contribute points, and there's a max of 15 points any single user can give to any musician. Gaming is hard."

**Q: How do musicians make money?**
> "Right now it's about audience building and discovery. Gig booking features are coming - venues will post shows, bands apply, and their MAINSTAGE scores speak for themselves."

**Q: What about venues?**
> "Venues can post gigs and discover bands with proven engagement. We're building the booking workflow now."

**Q: How is this different from SoundCloud/Bandcamp?**
> "Those are music hosting platforms. We're a community platform where engagement is transparent and gamified. You don't just upload music - you prove you can build an audience."
